  * Version 0.3.0

  * EXTREMLY IMPORTANT changes (read this):

    * Fix bug with scanf %S@\n for ocaml 3.13. We were unfortunetaly using an
      undocumented tolerance of Scanf in the previous version. You should
      consider making new release using this version that fixed this. 

      PACKAGES uploaded to oasis-db will be automatically "derived" before
      OCaml 3.13 release (i.e.  oUnit v1.1.1 will be regenerated with this new
      version as oUnit v1.1.1~oasis1).

      PACKAGES not uploaded to oasis-db need to be regeneratedr. In order not to 
      break 3rd party tools that consider a tarball constant, I recommend to 
      create a new version.

      INRIA OCaml team is synchronizing with us on this point.

  * Major changes: 

    * Handle the field "Pack: true" to be able to create packed libraries. It
      also installs .mli files for documentation into the target directory.
      The pack option is only supported for "OASISFormat: 0.3", you will need
      to update the version of your _oasis file to match it.


    * Introduce --[enable|disable]-[tests|docs] to disable tests and docs at
      oasis level. It seems a very common pattern to have a "Flag tests" to
      turn off by default the tests. This is now define as a standard var and
      you should remove you previous "Flag tests" and but you can continue to
      use "flag(tests)" where needed.

      You can now have the following example:
      ...

      Executable test_exec
        Install: false
        Build$: flag(tests)
        MainIs: testExec.ml
        BuildDepends: oUnit

      Test main
        Command: $test_exec
        TestTools: test_exec

      ...

      The "Run$: flag(tests)" is implicit for the section "Test main". The
      default value is "false" for tests. If all the executable for test are
      flagged correctly (Build$: flag(tests)), you'll get rid of the dependency
      on oUnit.

      It works the same for documentation, however the default is "true".
      (Closes: #866)

    * Allow to define interdependent flags
      
       In order to allow interdependent flags, we transform back lazy values into
       'unit -> string' functions. This allows to change a flag value on the
       command line and to update all the dependent values. 
       (Closes: #827, #938)

    * Deprecate the subcommand 'oasis setup-dev' in favor of 
      'oasis setup -setup-update {none|weak|dynamic}'
      
      It defines different ways to manage the auto-update of setup.ml:
      * 'none': this is the default mode, and the one you should use when
         distributing tarballs. No update is performed at al.
      * 'weak': the update is only triggered when something change in `_oasis`,
         we keep all files generated
      * 'dynamic': the content of 'setup.ml' is ultra small (<2kB) and we only
         keep a small 'setup.ml', 'Makefile' and 'configure'.
      
      The choice between 'weak' and 'dynamic' depends on the your need with
      regard to VCS and to the presence of `oasis'. The 'weak' allow to checkout
      the project from VCS and be able to work on it, without the need of
      installing 'oasis' as long as you don't change the file '_oasis'. But it 
      clutter your VCS history with changes to the build system each time you 
      change something in '_oasis'. The 'dynamic' mode gives you no VCS history 
      pollution but makes mandatory to have installed oasis libraries.

    * Don't copy executable in ocamlbuild
    
      Avoid copying executable to their real name. It helps to call ocamlbuild a
      single time for the whole build rather than calling it n time (n = number
      of executable sections) and copying resulting exec.
      
      This speeds up the build process because ocamlbuild doesn't have to
      compute/scan dependencies each time.
      
      The drawback is that you have to use $foo when you want to call 
      "Executable foo", because $foo will be _build/.../main.byte.
    
    * Change the way we parse command line like option (CCOpt, CCLib and the like). We have
      implemented a real POSIX command line parser, except that variables are processed by
      Buffer.add_substitute (except if correctly escaped, using
      Buffer.add_substitute escaping). 
      
      For example: 
        CCOpt: -DEXTERNAL_EXP10 -L/sw/lib "-framework vecLib"

      Will be parsed correctly and outputed according to target OS. 

    * Externalize ocamlmod in its own project, which become a dependencies.

  * Version 0.2.0

  * Split the project into 3 libraries and one executable:
    * oasis: the core library
    * oasis.base: the runtime library
    * oasis.builtin-plugins: various plugins (ocamlbuild, internal, none, custom)
    * the executable 'oasis' in lowercase which was 'OASIS' before 
      (Closes: #769)

  * Publish .mli and improve ocamldoc generated documentation (Closes: #667)

  * oasis library:
    * Ignore plugins even when parsing field
    * Allow to redirect messages through a function and use a context to avoid
      global variables. This is an OASIS-DB website requirement, but we fallback 
      to a global variable in oasis.base
    * Use the same policy as Debian for version comparison (copied from dpkg) 
      (Closes: #584)
    * Add MIT, CeCILL licenses and make unknown license less fatal 
      (Closes: #710, #557)
    * Allow https, ftp, mailto, svn, svn+ssh for URL (Closes: #753)
    * Replace Str by Pcre
    * Don't modify package data structure through plugins, we just issue warnings
      and error when something is missing. This is compensated by a better
      'quickstart' that can automatically complete required fields (e.g. it adds 
      'ocamlbuild' as a BuildDependency for 'ocamlbuild' plugin).
      (Closes: #552, #566)
    * Set default for test type to 'custom' plugin (Closes: #562)
    * Use a more simple lexer for _oasis (Closes: #579)
    * Warn if the use of '\t' to indent lines is inconsistent in an _oasis file
      (e.g. mix of ' ' and '\t')
    * Allow to use 'flag' as environment variables in _oasis (e.g. flag test can be used as 
      Command: echo $test) (Closes: #619)
    * ADVANCED USERS: Create a new scheme to synchronize data between the
      property list used to parse and print an _oasis file and the data structure
      representing it. This is a first step to avoid carrying property lists
      inside the data structure.  It should also allow to dump plugin data
      directly inside the data structure rather than having to do it "by hand".
      This allows to have a more complete quickstart support also (i.e. handling
      plugins directly). It also allows to manipulate the datastructures in a
      single place: with the scheme before you have to update the property list
      and the rest of the datastructure. (Closes: #705, #733)

  * oasis.base library:
    * Exit with an error code when tests fail
    * Don't account skipped test (Closes: #624)
    * Delegate the "setup-dev" actions to the executable 'oasis' rather than
      embedding it into setup.ml
    * Add a '-version' to setup.ml to know what version has generated the file 
      (Closes: #692)
    * Add a '-all' target that does "-configure", "-build", "-doc" and "-test"
      in one run (Closes: #551)
    * Add a '-reinstall' target that 'uninstall' and 'install' (Closes: #568)
    * Use the right command to delete file on Windows

  * executable 'oasis':
    * Use a subcommand scheme, like subversion. For example, it replaces the
      former "OASIS -setup" by "oasis setup". Each subcommand can be a small
      plugin
    * Add a "query" subcommand to extract data of _oasis from command line 
      (Closes: #691)
    * Add a "setup-clean" subcommand that removes generated files and helps
      cleaning OASIS_START/STOP section of their content 
      (Closes: #564, #623, #563)
    * Add a "check" subcommend that checks _oasis files  
    * Greatly improve the "quickstart" subcommand:
      * Take into account plugins in quickstart
      * Allow to have multiple choices for field Plugins in quickstart mode
      * Don't display help text at each question (Closes: #586)
      * Allow to create a doc (Closes: #633)
      * Allow to run a pager, editor or "oasis setup-dev" at the end 
        (Closes: #580, #582)
      * Don't accept '?' as an answer in quickstart (Closes: #587)
      * Add examples and all available licenses in the help of License field 
        (Closes: #559)
    * Keep generated files when 'oasis setup-dev' is called (Closes: #743)

  * Plugin "ocamlbuild":
    * Handle "Path: ." in generated _tags correctly (Closes: #570, #588)
    * Quick fix to handle .h files directly in CSources field
    * Include .mli in _tags (Closes: #572)
    * Pass -cclib and -dllpath options to ocamlmklib  (Closes: #629)
    * Don't pass -dlllib and -dllpath options to ocamlopt (Closes: #628)

  * Plugin "internal":
    * Create parent directories when installing with InternalInstall (Closes: #555)
    * Don't install data when section is not built (Closes: #554, #556)

  * Plugin "META":
    * Add an exists_if field to generated META file (Closes: #694)
