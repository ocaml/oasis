* Finish guess-cmx to install all files for libraries, integrate it in buildsys
* "..." in freeform doesn't work

* recompilation of .cmxs, must have a pb in detecting update

* Feature protect big changes like the section Object.

* fix +x for configure in oasis-dist

IDEAS:

* oasis-autogenerate: automatically file Modules and ModulesInternal using a field
 XAutoGenModulesExpression: src/*.mli
 XAutoGenModulesInternal: src/*.ml, -src/*.mli

* oasis-spandeps: create a directory ext/ containing depends and compile/install them
  in the project.
  Bonus point: use a link/file to include project checkout elsewhere on the FS
  Bonus point: also include rev-dependencies
